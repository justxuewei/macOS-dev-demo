# masOS dev demo

This repo records the process of learning development for macOS. The sub-projects are:

- Window Management(at window-management)
  - the relationship between window controller and window
  - the relationship between view controller and view
  - build the UI and setup AutoLayout by code completely
  - implement a seem-like borderless window that removes titlebar and zoom button but has an ability to become key window, window shadow, and a proper corner radius (see `WindowBorderless.Swift`)
